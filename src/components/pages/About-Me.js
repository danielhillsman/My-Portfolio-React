        Hello! My name is Daniel Hillsman. I have a creative personality that is used well for solving problems and catching issues. I work well by myself or with groups.
        I am extremely easy going and flexible. Easy to manage, and great at helping others. I will always go above-and-beyond to achieve more than the exceptional criteria and qualifications for my clients and employers.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am a graduate (May 17, 2022) of UCLA Extension - Coding Bootcamp "Full-Stack-Developer." Which means I am trained in both Back-End and Front-End Development. I can create from scratch a website, while also knowing how to database the data.
        <br />
        <br />
        I am trained in: Html, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and third-party-APIs.
        <br />
        NOTE: I am adaptable and completely willing to learn a knew language. I am easy going, hard working, and a critical thinker.       
        <br />  
        If you have any questions or would like to connect with me, please click on the "Contact Me" Tab above.
